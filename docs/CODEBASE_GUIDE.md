# Codebase Guide

This document is for a developer picking up this repository for the first
time. It explains *how the code is organized and why*, not how to deploy
it — for setup, environment variables, and operational limitations, see
[README.md](../README.md).

## What this app does

A Streamlit dashboard that screens all current Nifty 50 stocks daily and
classifies each as **Green / Amber / Red / Unavailable** based on three
criteria: dividend yield, 1/5/20-day price momentum, and PEG ratio. Users
sign in (Supabase Auth), configure their own thresholds, set alerts, and
browse per-stock detail pages with charts.

The one thing to internalize before reading further: **raw market data,
normalized market data, and calculated results are three distinct layers,
stored in three distinct kinds of tables**, and the code is organized
around that same separation:

```
Provider (Dhan/yfinance/mock)  --fetch-->  raw quotes/OHLCV/fundamentals
        |
        v  (refresh_service normalizes + persists)
price_history / fundamental_snapshots / dividend_events   <- normalized, provider-agnostic
        |
        v  (screener_service reads normalized data, runs pure calculations)
daily_screener_snapshots   <- one calculated row per symbol per day (the audit trail)
        |
        v  (Streamlit pages read via latest_screener_view, re-apply per-user thresholds)
Dashboard / Stock Detail
```

                      (supabase/migrations/*.sql)

src/data_providers/  Fetches from external vendors (Dhan/yfinance/mock/
                      manual CSV). Used only by refresh_service and the
                      one-off scripts -- pages never call a provider
                      directly, they only ever read already-persisted
                      data via repositories.

src/calculations/    Pure functions, no I/O, no Streamlit, no Supabase.
                      This is where the actual spec logic (returns, TTM
                      yield, Green/Amber/Red rules) lives, and it's the
                      most heavily unit-tested part of the codebase for
                      exactly that reason.

src/models/          Pydantic models shared by every layer above.
src/utils/           Cross-cutting helpers: formatting, timezones,
                      Streamlit session/auth, shared UI fragments, logging.
```

Why split calculations out as pure functions instead of methods on a
service class: every rule in the spec (exactly-0%-is-neutral, missing
data must never read as a failed criterion, PEG passes at-or-below its
threshold while the other two criteria pass strictly above theirs) is a
one-line, deterministic, easily-misremembered rule. Keeping them as
standalone functions with no dependencies means every rule has a direct,
fast, no-mocking-required test in `tests/test_calculations_*.py`.

## Database schema

All migrations live in `supabase/migrations/`, applied in numeric order
(`0001` → `0004`). Twelve tables, in three groups:

**Reference data** (written by `scripts/fetch_nifty50_constituents.py` /
`seed.sql`, read-only to the app):
- `nifty50_constituents` — which symbols are in the index and when (supports historical reconstitution tracking)
- `companies` — name/sector/industry per symbol

**Market data** (written by `refresh_service` / provider scripts, read-only to the app):
- `price_history` — daily OHLCV, one row per symbol per trade_date
- `fundamental_snapshots` — PE/PEG/EPS/market cap, one row per symbol per as_of_date
- `dividend_events` — individual ex-dividend cash amounts
- `daily_screener_snapshots` — the calculated audit trail: one row per symbol per day with the computed returns, TTM yield, criteria A/B/C, and status. This is what the classification-history chart on Stock Detail reads.
- `provider_fetch_log` — success/failure log for every provider call, used for the Dashboard's "data freshness" indicator and for retry/backoff auditing

**Per-user data** (RLS-scoped to `auth.uid() = user_id`):
- `user_settings` — thresholds, theme
- `saved_filters` — named filter presets
- `user_positions` — entry/target/stop-loss/notes per symbol
- `alerts` — alert configs
- `notification_log` — alert-fired history, deduped via a unique `dedupe_key`

Two generated helpers, defined in `0003_views_functions.sql` (and patched
in `0004`):
- `latest_screener_view` — one joined row per current constituent (companies + its latest daily_screener_snapshot). This is what the Dashboard queries in a single call instead of joining client-side. `0004` added `coalesce(status, 'unavailable')` / `coalesce(data_quality, '{}')` here because a constituent with no snapshot yet would otherwise return `NULL` for those columns, which fails Pydantic validation on the `ScreenerRow` model.
- `get_classification_history(symbol, days)` — a SQL function returning one symbol's snapshot history, used by the Stock Detail status-over-time chart.

RLS (`0002_rls_policies.sql`): shared tables are `SELECT`-only for the
`authenticated` role (writes only happen via the service-role key, which
bypasses RLS entirely); per-user tables use `auth.uid() = user_id` on
every operation. `0004` also added a foreign key from
`nifty50_constituents.symbol` to `companies.symbol` — without it,
PostgREST can't resolve the embedded-resource query
`companies_repo.list_current_constituents()` uses (`select("symbol,
companies(...)")`); PostgREST needs a declared FK to know how to join two
tables via that syntax.

## Domain models (`src/models/`)

Pydantic v2 models, one file per concern (`company.py`, `market_data.py`,
`screener.py`, `user.py`, `alert.py`, `fetch_log.py`), plus `enums.py` for
every `StrEnum` (`ScreenerStatus`, `MarketState`, `AlertType`,
`NotificationChannel`, `Theme`, `FetchType`, `FetchStatus`,
`DividendType`). Everything is re-exported from `src/models/__init__.py`.

Worth knowing:
- `PricePoint.effective_close` prefers `adjusted_close` over `close` — every return calculation goes through this property, not the raw fields directly.
- `DataQuality` (in `screener.py`) is a structured record of *which* inputs were missing/stale when a row was classified — it's not inferred after the fact, it's built alongside the classification so the UI can always explain an Unavailable row.
- `UserPosition.risk_reward_ratio` is a computed property, not stored — `(target - entry) / (entry - stop_loss)`, `None` if any leg is missing or risk is non-positive.

## Calculation engine (`src/calculations/`)

No I/O, no Streamlit, no Supabase imports — every function here takes
plain values and returns plain values, which is what makes them cheap to
test exhaustively.

- **`returns.py`**: `pct_return(latest, base)` and `return_1d/5d/20d(latest_price, historical_closes)`. `historical_closes` must be ordered oldest→newest and must NOT include the day `latest_price` came from — see the note on `screener_service.py` under [Services](#services-srcservices) for a real bug this exact boundary caused.
- **`dividends.py`**: `ttm_dividend_sum`/`ttm_dividend_yield(events, as_of_date, latest_price)`. An empty `dividend_events` list sums to `0.0` (a confirmed-zero yield), not `None` — missing-vs-zero is a distinction the *caller* (the provider/repo layer) is responsible for, based on whether a fundamentals fetch actually succeeded.
- **`classification.py`**: `criterion_a/b/c()` each return `bool | None` (`None` = missing input, never a fail). `criterion_a`/`criterion_b` pass strictly *above* their threshold; `criterion_c` (PEG) passes *at or below* its threshold — the direction is deliberately reversed for PEG, since a lower PEG is the conventionally desirable side. `classify(a, b, c, is_stale)` short-circuits to `UNAVAILABLE` if `is_stale` or any criterion is `None`, before ever checking pass/fail counts — this ordering is the whole point of the "missing is never a failure" rule. `build_classification(...)` is the one-stop version that also assembles the `DataQuality` record.
- **`moving_averages.py`**: `moving_average_series()` (pandas, for the Stock Detail chart, `min_periods=window` so a partial window renders as `NaN` not a misleading partial average) and `latest_moving_average()` (scalar, for scorecards).

`tests/test_calculations_*.py` specifically cover the boundary cases:
exactly 0% return (fails B), exactly 3.00% yield (fails A, strict `>`),
exactly PEG 1.00 at the default threshold (**passes** C, since C uses
`<=`), missing vs. confirmed-zero, and every missing-data combination for
`classify()`.

## Data providers (`src/data_providers/`)

Two abstract interfaces in `base.py`:

```python
class PriceDataProvider(ABC):
    def get_quote(symbol) -> Quote
    def get_quotes(symbols) -> dict[str, Quote]
    def get_historical_daily(symbol, from_date, to_date) -> list[PricePoint]

class FundamentalsDataProvider(ABC):
    def get_fundamentals(symbol, as_of) -> FundamentalSnapshot | None
    def get_dividend_history(symbol, from_date, to_date) -> list[DividendEvent]
```

They're split because a price vendor and a fundamentals vendor are
independently swappable — no single vendor considered for this project
covers both well. Implementations:

| | Price | Fundamentals |
|---|---|---|
| `dhan_provider.py` | `DhanProvider` — live, DhanHQ v2, prices only | — |
| `yfinance_provider.py` | `YFinancePriceProvider` | `YFinanceFundamentalsProvider` — both live, free, no key |
| `manual_fundamentals_provider.py` | — | `ManualFundamentalsProvider` — reads `data/*.csv`, populated by `scripts/import_screener_csv.py` |
| `mock_provider.py` | `MockPriceProvider` | `MockFundamentalsProvider` — deterministic synthetic data, seeded per-symbol |

`factory.py` picks the concrete class from `Settings.market_data_provider`
/ `Settings.fundamentals_provider` (`.env`: `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER`,
`FUNDAMENTALS_PROVIDER`). **To add a new vendor**: implement the relevant
ABC, add one branch in `factory.py`, add the new value to the `Literal[...]`
type in `src/config.py`. Nothing else needs to change — `refresh_service`
and the scripts only ever go through the ABC's interface.

`dhan_provider.py` resolves NSE symbols to Dhan's numeric `security_id`
via fuzzy column-matching against Dhan's published instrument-master CSV
(cached with `@lru_cache`), since Dhan requires that ID rather than the
trading symbol directly. `yfinance_provider.py` just appends `.NS` to the
symbol. Both wrap network calls in `tenacity` retry with exponential
backoff and a client-side request-rate throttle.

## Repositories (`src/repositories/`)

One module per table/concern (`companies_repo.py`, `price_repo.py`,
`fundamentals_repo.py`, `dividends_repo.py`, `snapshot_repo.py`,
`settings_repo.py`, `alerts_repo.py`, `notification_repo.py`,
`fetch_log_repo.py`), plus `supabase_client.py` for client construction.

The one convention that matters everywhere in this layer: **every
function takes an explicit `Client` argument** — there's no module-level
singleton client. `supabase_client.py` exposes two factories:

```python
get_service_client()               # SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, bypasses RLS
get_user_client(access_token, ...)  # SUPABASE_ANON_KEY + a logged-in user's JWT, RLS applies
```

Server-side scripts (`scripts/*.py`, `refresh_service.py`) always use
`get_service_client()`. Streamlit pages always use
`src.utils.session.get_user_client_cached()`, which wraps
`get_user_client()` with the current session's tokens from
`st.session_state`. **Never import `get_service_client` into `pages/*.py`**
— that would ship the service-role key's privileges to whatever a page
does, defeating RLS entirely.

## Services (`src/services/`)

- **`screener_service.py`** — `compute_screener_row(...)` is the pure calculation step (calls into `src/calculations/`, fully unit-tested in `tests/test_screener_service.py`). `refresh_screener_row_for_symbol(client, symbol, ...)` is the I/O wrapper: reads normalized data back out of Supabase, calls `compute_screener_row`, persists the result. **A real bug was found and fixed here**: the history-window upper bound must be `latest_point.trade_date - 1 day`, not a fixed `as_of_date - 1` — when no intraday quote has been fetched yet, `get_latest_close()` returns the most recent EOD row, which could be *older* than `as_of_date - 1`; using a fixed cutoff let that same row appear as both `latest_price` and the last element of `historical_closes`, silently forcing `return_1d` to exactly `0.0` for every symbol. If you ever touch this function, keep that comment — it's easy to reintroduce.
- **`refresh_service.py`** — fetch (via a provider) → normalize → persist raw/normalized records, with retry + `provider_fetch_log` auditing. Intraday price upserts only include the columns actually fetched (`close`/`adjusted_close`) so a same-day EOD upsert filling `open`/`high`/`low` later isn't clobbered, and vice versa (PostgREST's upsert only sets columns present in the request body).
- **`alert_service.py`** — `evaluate_alert(alert, current_snapshot, previous_snapshot, stock_name, now)` is pure (no I/O) and covers all ten `AlertType` values, cooldown (`last_triggered_at` + `cooldown_minutes`), and a stable SHA-256 `dedupe_key` (same alert+symbol+day always produces the same key, so a DB-level unique constraint on `notification_log.dedupe_key` is the final backstop against double-firing). Callers persist the returned `NotificationEvent`s via `notifications/inapp_adapter.py`.
- **`market_calendar.py`** — NSE trading-day/market-state logic. The holiday list (`NSE_HOLIDAYS`) is hardcoded **per calendar year** and needs a manual update every year; falls back to weekday-only for years not listed.
- **`threshold_override.py`** — `daily_screener_snapshots` is computed server-side against *default* thresholds (the stable audit trail); a signed-in user can configure their own thresholds in Settings, so pages re-run `build_classification()` client-side against the row's stored raw inputs (which are threshold-independent) to reflect that choice, without a server-side recompute per user. Also recomputes `is_stale` from `data_quality.stale_minutes` against the user's own `stale_data_threshold_minutes` when available.
- **`explanation.py`** — `explain_classification(row)` builds the plain-English sentence shown on Stock Detail, branching on which criteria passed/failed/are missing.

## Notifications (`src/notifications/`)

`base.py` defines `NotificationAdapter.send(event) -> bool`. Only
`inapp_adapter.py` is implemented (writes to `notification_log`, surfaced
via the Alerts page). `email_adapter.py`, `telegram_adapter.py`,
`slack_adapter.py` are stubs — each raises `NotImplementedError` with a
docstring describing exactly what to wire up (credentials needed, what
API call to make). Extending notifications means implementing one of
these, not touching `alert_service.py`.

## Streamlit app (`app.py`, `pages/`)

`app.py` is the landing page (Streamlit's "Home" in the sidebar nav,
titled "app"). Every page in `pages/` starts with
`require_login()` (from `src.utils.session`), which either lets the page
proceed (a valid session exists) or renders the Sign in / Create account /
Forgot password tabs and `st.stop()`s.

- **`1_Dashboard.py`** — loads `latest_screener_view` via `snapshot_repo.get_latest_screener()`, applies the signed-in user's thresholds via `threshold_override.apply_user_thresholds()`, renders metric cards (also usable as quick filters, wired through `st.session_state["status_filter"]`), sidebar filters, and the screener table (rendered as an HTML table via `.to_html()` so status badges can use colored spans — `st.dataframe` doesn't support arbitrary per-cell HTML).
- **`2_Stock_Detail.py`** — the most feature-dense page: Plotly candlestick (falls back to a line chart if OHLC is incomplete) with volume subplot, moving averages, entry/target/stop-loss lines, dividend timeline, classification-history chart, position notes form, and inline alert creation.
- **`3_Alerts.py`** — alert CRUD (including portfolio-wide alerts, `symbol IS NULL`) and notification history.
- **`4_Settings.py`** — per-user thresholds, theme, change-password.

## Auth: a non-obvious quirk

**Password reset does not use Supabase's email link.** This was tried
first and doesn't work, for a reason worth understanding before touching
auth code again: Supabase's recovery link puts the session token in the
URL **fragment** (`#access_token=...&type=recovery`), which browsers never
send to any server. The obvious workaround — inject JS via `st.iframe`
that reads `window.parent.location.hash` and rewrites the parent URL — is
blocked by the browser itself: Streamlit's iframe sandbox doesn't include
`allow-top-navigation`, so any attempt to navigate the parent frame from
inside it throws
`SecurityError: ... does not have permission to navigate the target frame`,
confirmed directly in a live test. (Reading the parent's location *is*
allowed via `allow-same-origin`; navigating it is a separate, unrelated
sandbox permission, and Streamlit grants the former but not the latter.)

The actual fix, in `src/utils/session.py`: Supabase's password-recovery
email also carries a 6-digit one-time code via the `{{ .Token }}` template
variable (this requires editing the Reset Password template in the
Supabase dashboard to include it, and requires custom SMTP to be
configured — Supabase's built-in email service ignores template edits
entirely). The user types that code into the app's "Forgot password?" tab,
which is verified server-side via `auth.verify_otp({"email", "token",
"type": "recovery"})` — no redirect, no JS, no sandbox issue. If you're
tempted to "fix" the link-based flow later, read this section again first.

`Settings.app_base_url` (`.env: APP_BASE_URL`) is still used for
`email_redirect_to` on sign-up confirmation — that flow doesn't need the
token at all (the user just confirms and then signs in normally), so a
plain correct redirect URL is sufficient there.

## Utils (`src/utils/`)

- **`session.py`** — all Supabase Auth + `st.session_state` handling: `sign_in`/`sign_up`/`sign_out`, `request_password_reset`/`verify_recovery_code`/`set_new_password`, `require_login()` (the gate every page calls), `get_user_client_cached()`.
- **`formatting.py`** — Indian-numbering-system currency formatting (`format_inr`, lakh/crore grouping), `format_pct`, `direction_arrow`, `pass_fail_badge`.
- **`timezones.py`** — `now_ist()`/`to_ist()`/`format_ist()`, thin wrappers around `pytz`.
- **`ui.py`** — shared fragments: `status_badge()` (colored HTML span), `market_state_label()`, `buy_sell_label()` (Green→"Model Buy Watch" etc., per the spec's no-guarantee wording), `render_disclaimer()`, `plotly_template()`.
- **`logging.py`** — `get_logger(name)`, configures `logging.basicConfig` once from `Settings.log_level`.

## Scripts (`scripts/`)

All are standalone CLI entrypoints (`sys.path.insert` a project-root hack
at the top so they run without installing the package) using
`get_service_client()`:

- **`run_refresh.py --mode=intraday|eod|fundamentals|screener|all [--daemon]`** — the main scheduled job, called by `.github/workflows/refresh_prices.yml` (one-shot per mode) or run standalone with `--daemon` for an APScheduler loop.
- **`fetch_nifty50_constituents.py`** — re-applies a hardcoded `CURRENT_CONSTITUENTS` dict (kept in sync with `seed.sql` by hand) and reconciles which symbols are no longer current.
- **`seed_mock_data.py`** — backfills ~400 days of synthetic prices/fundamentals/dividends and ~60 days of daily snapshots using the mock providers, regardless of the configured env provider. This is the fastest way to get a fully populated local/dev environment.
- **`import_screener_csv.py`** — converts a screener.in "Export screen results" CSV into `fundamental_snapshots`/`dividend_events` rows, with fuzzy column-name matching since the export's exact columns depend on what the user chose to include on screener.in.

## Tests (`tests/`)

Run with `pytest` (config in `pytest.ini`; `-m "not integration"` is the
default, since there are no `@pytest.mark.integration` tests currently —
everything either mocks external state or is a pure function, so the
whole suite runs with zero network access). One file per module under
test, named `test_<module>.py`. If you add a new pure function to
`src/calculations/` or `src/services/`, it should get a same-pattern test
file — boundary cases (exactly-at-threshold, missing data) are the ones
that matter most given how the spec is written.

## Common changes, step by step

**Add a new market-data or fundamentals vendor**: implement
`PriceDataProvider` or `FundamentalsDataProvider` in a new file under
`src/data_providers/`, add a branch in `factory.py`, add the new literal
value to `src/config.py`'s `Settings.market_data_provider` /
`fundamentals_provider` type.

**Add a new alert type**: add the value to `AlertType` in
`src/models/enums.py`, add a branch in `alert_service.evaluate_alert()`,
add the matching `config` fields to the alert-creation UI in
`pages/2_Stock_Detail.py` and `pages/3_Alerts.py`, add the CHECK constraint
value in a new migration altering `alerts.alert_type`.

**Add a new Streamlit page**: create `pages/N_Name.py`, start it with
`require_login()`, use `get_user_client_cached()` for all data access
(never `get_service_client()`), add a `st.page_link(...)` to it from
`app.py`.

**Add a new table**: write a new numbered migration in
`supabase/migrations/`, add RLS policies for it (per-user tables need
`auth.uid() = user_id` policies; shared tables need an `authenticated`
read-only policy — see `0002_rls_policies.sql` for the pattern), add a
matching Pydantic model in `src/models/`, add a repository module in
`src/repositories/`.

**Change a calculation rule**: everything lives in `src/calculations/`.
Change the function, then update/add the corresponding test in
`tests/test_calculations_*.py` — these tests are the executable spec, so
a rule change without a test change is a red flag on review.
